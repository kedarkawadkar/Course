Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Kedar Kawadkar
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Basically each problem while solving via the Divide and Conquer Algorithms, is broken into three parts. 1) Divide: Where the problem is divided into smaller parts. 2) Conquer: In this step the smaller problems are solved. 3) Combine: In this step, the smaller solutions are combined to solve the issue.
